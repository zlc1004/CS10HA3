- PRACTICE WIN-WIN THINKING

  > It is not easy to be happy when your friend gets something, and you don’t. It may also be hard to find solutions to problems so that both of you can win. But you can do it.

Start with yourself and stop competing and comparing. When you manage to change your thinking, notice the good feelings the win-win attitude brings on.
