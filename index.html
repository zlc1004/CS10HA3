                <p>SMART goal setting, which stands for Specific, Measurable,
                    Attainable, Relevant, and Time-Based, is an
                    effective process for setting and achieving your business
                    goals. Applying the SMART grid to your goals
                    will help you create more specific, achievable targets for
                    your business, and measure your progress
                    toward them.</p>

                            actions skillfully. Improving our technique
                            enhances our performance across various tasks.</p>

                            encourage us to take on new challenges and
                            support task engagement and connection. As an
                            antithesis, avoidance goals, where we attempt to
                            prevent undesirable consequences, can evoke negative
                            feelings such as stress, anxiety, and
                            dread.</p>

                            typically increase the enjoyment of the

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>Appropriate therapeutic goals offer opportunities to
                            manage emotions better, build a more
                            positive self-image, and learn coping

                    <blockquote>
                        <p>It is not easy to be happy when your friend gets
                            something, and you don’t. It may also be hard to
                            find solutions to problems so that both of you can
                            win. But you can do it. If it is too hard for
                            you, it means that you still haven’t won the private
                            victory, so you are insecure, you feel
                            threatened by others, and so you are jealous. Start
                            with yourself and stop competing and
                            comparing. When you manage to change your thinking,
                            notice the good feelings the win-win
                            attitude brings on.</p>
